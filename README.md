# WeightAwareness
A base testing app to learn the basics of java while controlling my body weight and body fat.

It helped me learn about:
* Writting to files. 
* Reading from files
* Using Collections
* Charts and forms with JavaFX
* Fixing exceptions and prevent user error. 

Still to do:
* Use a REST API to keep the data online. 


## How does it work?
It is easy to put on or off weight, what's hard is to control that we don't become skinny-fat on the process of losing it. 
What this app does (so far) is to provide two graphs with real data (sample data is own measures) to show you if you're loosing weight but none of it is fat. There's no point in losing weight if all that's lost is muscle and we become 20% fat in the process. 
You see the progress by comparing the graph on the top (weight) with the curve on the graph on the bottom (body fat) and ensuring they correlate or better, the body fat goes down faster. If not, you need to have a look at your eating habits, not just eat less. 

Example of how it looks as of today (19th of July of 2017).
