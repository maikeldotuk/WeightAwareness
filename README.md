# WeightAwareness
A base testing app to learn the basics of java while controlling my body weight and body fat.

It helped me learn about:
* Writting to files. 
* Reading from files
* Using Collections
* Charts and forms with JavaFX
* Fixing exceptions and prevent user error. 

Still to do:
* Use a REST API to keep the data online.
